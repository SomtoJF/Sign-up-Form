# Sign-up Form (purpleWave)
## About
This is a frontend only project inspired by THE ODIN PROJECT. It was designed and built as a test of my knowledge of HTML5 forms as well as client-side form validations.
## Input Controls
* The FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME input controls only accept text up to a maximum of 20 characters.
* The EMAIL input control auto-validates the authenticity of data it collects through the use of HTML5's email validation system.
* The PHONE NUMBER input control validates based on a regex pattern via the ``` pattern="" ``` attribute.
* The two PASSWORD input controls also validate based on a regex pattern via the ``` pattern="" ``` attribute. It accepts a minimun of 6 characters which must contain at least; 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number.
